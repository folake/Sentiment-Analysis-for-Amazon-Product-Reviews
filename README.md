# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

## Overview
In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on a collection of product reviews from an e-commerce platform. Utilizing a combination of text reviews and associated ratings, I developed a model capable of classifying the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral. The project leveraged natural language processing techniques and machine learning to analyze and categorize sentiments, providing valuable insights into customer feedback.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python Libraries**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis (Pandas, NLTK).
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Employed for building and evaluating the sentiment analysis model (Scikit-learn, Spacy).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary platform for documenting the analysis process.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and sharing the project's codebase.
- **Streamlit**: Enabled the creation of an interactive web application to showcase the analysis results.

## Process and Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: I began by importing the dataset into an SQL environment, ensuring the data was clean and structured for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I conducted an initial exploration to understand the data's characteristics and identify any patterns.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it was in the optimal format for modeling.
4. **Sentiment Labeling**: Each review was labeled according to its sentiment, derived from the text content and associated ratings.
5. **Text Vectorization**: I transformed the text data into a numerical format that machine learning models could interpret.
6. **Model Building**: A machine learning model was constructed to accurately classify the reviews' sentiment.
7. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was rigorously assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.



## Conclusion and Next Steps
The project successfully achieved its objective of classifying product review sentiments. The insights gained from this analysis can be leveraged to improve product offerings and customer experience. Future work may involve refining the model further and expanding the analysis to include a larger dataset or additional review platforms.
